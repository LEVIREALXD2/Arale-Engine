behiu235 told me I can't use their codes because they're not allowing it anymore
man, this sucks, I don't like FNF Community
so these menus won't get any updates anymore (OptionsState is a Exception, I'll update it anyway because It's only main thing I took from NovaFlare)
I added the New NovaFlare Freeplay as a last thing because I want to look it once

Possible Questions & Answers:
Q: If you want to look NovaFlare Freeplay Menu, why you just don't download the engine and look?
A: Well, I don't like NovaFlare Engine's itself and It takes too much storage, I don't have enough storage to install it

Q: Why won't you just delete something and download the engine then?
A: I don't wanna install any FNF Engine (I'll remove Psych Extended from my phone too when It finished)
